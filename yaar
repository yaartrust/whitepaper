The common integration of blockchain networks are actually limited to a ‚Äúnot so open‚Äù way to operate and or transmit information across different infrastructures and in many cases, conflicts arise due of multiple technical issues. The losses of important information attached to a payment that commonly may not communicate all the data correctly to the receiving counterpart. We focus in the inter-operability capabilities of each network to make blockchain infrastructures actually safe-connected and then be sure to share only authorized information on billions of transactions.

### If any bank eco-system look obsolete then we will invest in upgrading to our new Open Banking standards to provide a better services to scale on demand.

## We must avoid market monopoly

Adding a layer of security inside each transaction will provide an extra service that today citizens are now deserve to guarantee financial safety standards to match privacy policy globally. Business or private clients using YAAR Tokens on YAAR compatible Blockchains will receive a better experience thanks to a proprietary AI solution capable to handle requirements based on user settings and adapt to each country local rules for financial transactions.

An example: A US citizen like to purchase a Tea gift box from an e-commerce store in Sri Lanka, and want to pay with his credit card. The e-commerce store requires also the buyer passport number and pretend he must attach his passport copy to the order. Seller country rules require the buyer passport copy by law. So maybe the buyer will not share his important sensible information because lack of trust of the security system of the seller e-commerce platform and then prefer to cancel the order.  How the buyer (you) can actually know the global country trading rules and requirements to fulfil an order correctly? How you can trust the network infrastructure security of someone else thousands of miles away? Actually, is very complicated to track regulations worldwide and trusting the security practice of other unknow businesses. Even very important corporation get hacked daily and millions of users sensible data are compromised and then sold to the black market at the best offers.

At YAAR we develop and invest in research and security to track each country regulation updates to grant our blockchain will follow international trading laws. We must assure each country will adopt to a network standard that exchange client‚Äôs data following specific principle protecting your privacy and assets on each transaction. Syncing our blockchain to existing ones and or integrate our solutions into obsolete banking infrastructure allow us to archive our goals making each transaction to carry only verified user‚Äôs data settings and very important almost instantly. Our clients will engage with applications and websites to pay with cryptocurrency and even when purchasing at local store with authorized credit cards will then be normal to feel secure and trust the entire financial infrastructure.

## Why the name YAAR?

Commonly used in India YAAR mean friend! YAAR mean buddy and so YAAR Tokens will become a friendly secure way to exchange funds when buying products and services worldwide while keeping track of sensible information‚Äôs broadcasted on the blockchain.

## YAAR=YOU

Actually, the fresh cryptocurrency world does not create the necessary stability required to be adapted globally on each banking systems. It scares novice afraid to potentially lose their entire assets in a single day. For this reason, we designed YAAR to become an incredibly stable cryptocurrency that avoid volatility and satisfy users‚Äôneeds to trust a financial infrastructure that perform.

Creating a specific algorithm that constantly monitor multiple countries financial activities‚Äô and will trigger on a long time period only. The entire worldwide currency value is based on beliefs.

Also, we allow our business users to opt for an automatic pricing variation on the front-end when some specific market conditions are reached. This automatic pricing future will be available to merchants adopting our payment infrastructure on existing e-commerce channels.

### ## Understanding community needs in each connected country will allow YAAR‚Äôs team to support adoption of Open Banking solutions on blockchain.

Our technology partners are established companies with already proven records of hardware infrastructure security and performance capable to accomplish with highest YAAR‚Äôs  infrastructure requirements. Soon our business partners list will be available on our website under the country development list category.

We inform our qualified clients and partners interested to contribute to YAAR technology development and adoption in the near future that the main YAAR blockchain development will be maintained by multiple offices globally, each one following different regulation. In the case we ‚ÄúYAAR‚Äù the company behind the project will prefer to start a fundraising campaign we will always inform in advance publicly and or privately each investor of such ICO and Crow funding opportunity. We will publish accordingly all required information on our websites and other social networks. In reference of banking activity, we will then confirm each relative financial license following local regulations if required. Landing activity and emission of new credit cards are also subject to local regulations and authorization and may vary accordingly.

## Infamously Imperfect
### Yes! Is time to explain why we may be not in love with contemporary global financial system

The proves our global financial system is incapable to sustain itself under pressures is clearly exposed daily on newspapers. In 2019 we are targeted by trade wars news and financial crisis spreading in multiple country causing currency devaluation reaching historical minimum. Citizens with the intent to save their financial assets are forced to withdraw from local banks and exchange cash into foreign currency.
September 2019 news:

    Argentina set national limit on currency exchange to max 10000$
    Canadian consumer confidence big dive
    Brazil‚Äôs stocks affected since global economy slows.
    America applying import tariffs to China
    Venezuela ‚Äúgrowing political discontent further fueled by skyrocketing hyperinflation‚Äù
    Italian debt and political instability force TAX raising
    UK ‚ÄúBrexit situation stimulates collapse in UK building and construction orders‚Äù
    UK Pounds drops 1.20$

These are few updates from international newspapers and for what we can predict , no improvements at the horizon.

Would you agree with another annoying attempt by an European Central Bank‚Äôs executive board quotes about paranoid issues over the planned cryptocurrency Libra‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI sincerely hope that the people of Europe will not be tempted to leave behind the safety and soundness of established payment solutions and channels in favor of the beguiling but treacherous promises of Facebook‚Äôs siren call,‚Äù said Yves Mersch.

The above is just another desperate intent from government officials trying to dim alternative currency and blockchain capabilities.

Regarding the Money Loundry scandals from:

    Deutsche Bank faces action over $20bn Russian money-laundering scheme
    How the Danske Bank money-laundering scheme involving $230 billion unraveled

How possibly politics can be so bold trying to  limit the blockchain adoptions when billions of dollars are cleaned yearly by international well known banks?

So KYC policy (Know Your Customer)  is now integrated in almost all crypto exchanges or where online payment with virtual currency become standards.

### We voluntary skip to comment the 2008 worldwide economy‚Äôs collapse.

# You are FREE to deserve a better Open Financial System

## Pillars

Brilliant intention to undertake intrinsic economic growth theory by leveraging massive adoption of blockchain infrastructure into out-of-date financial markets.

Soon we will share our proprietary algorithm characteristics attaching more data to support settlement theory to YAAR Open Banking Solutions.
